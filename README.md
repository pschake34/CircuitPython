## ColorFade

### Description

This first assignment of Engineering III was a fairly simple intro project. The goal was to make an RGB LED fade between colors. My version cycles linearly through the colors by first making the r value go up, then the g, then the b. After all the color values reach 100, they go down in the order r, g, b.
