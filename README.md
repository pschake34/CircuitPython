## ColorFade

### Description

This first assignment of Engineering III was a fairly simple intro project. The goal was to make an RGB LED fade between colors. My version cycles linearly through the colors by first making the r value go up, then the g, then the b. After all the color values reach 100, they go down in the order r, g, b.

### Conclusion

This was a nice simple assignment to get us started on the year. I had some issues initially with the logic for the program, but that was probably just because I was a little bit rusty.
